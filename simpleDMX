/*
  Example sketch for controlling a neopixel strip via DMX. This will use up
  either 4x channels if not using any animations, or 5x channels if animations
  are used.
  DMX library is from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dmxlibraryforar/?source=typ_redirect
  NeoPixel library is here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
  A lot more information about the NeoPixel library can be found here:
  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-use
  On the CQRobot shield, Jumper #2 needs to be set to Slave
  TX & RX pins need to be set to UART when the device is connected to the
  DMX512 network, or removed or placed on IO when uploading code to the Uno.
  Digital pin to use for the Neopixel Signal line is set with NEOPIXEL_PIN
  This sketch takes advantage of the fact that both DMX and the NeoPixel library
  use a "byte" of data, or a value from 0-255. This means that we can directly
  take the value that we get from the DMX network and write it to Red, Green,
  and blue. For more information about variables, see:
  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/VariableDeclaration

//----------------- WARNING FROM ADAFRUIT --------------------------------------
// IMPORTANT: To reduce NeoPixel burnout risk, add 1000 uF capacitor across
// pixel power leads, add 300 - 500 Ohm resistor on first pixel's data input
// and minimize distance between Arduino and first pixel.  Avoid connecting
// on a live circuit...if you must, connect GND first.

  // setPixelColor later. It's a function built into the Adafruit library
  // that makes the next part easier.

  // Since each pixel is individually adressable, we have to tell each what they
  // need to be. This for loop essentially says "for every pixel from #0 all the
  // way to strip length, set the color to the value we calculated earlier".
  // NeoPixels don't live update their color when you call setPixelColor, so this
  // allows us to set the color of each pixel without seeing a stairstep effect
  // as they each update one by one (even if it would be stupid fast).
  for( int i = 0; i<STRING_LENGTH; i++){
    strip.setPixelColor(i, color);
  }


  // this configures intensity of the ENTIRE strip. It is generally not recommended
  // to call this anywhere but void setup() but we're trying to get the most
  // control possible. If the strip appears to flicker, comment this line out
  // and it can be called once during setup() if max intensity is too much.
  // strip.setBrightness(intensity);

  // strip.show takes all of the previous commands we've sent to the library
  // and actually updates the color on the strip.
